Ruling: dispatch implementers sequentially per SDD; root performs independent integration concurrently. Workers do not commit shared tree; root makes one reviewed final commit on main as explicitly authorized.

Task 1: fix round 1/5 — orbital overlap addressed; scoped reviewer approved. Implementation data/powers/progression, no intermediate commit per main ruling.
Task 1: complete (task-1-review.md spec+quality approved, focused VM checks passed).
Task 2: fix round 1/5 — independent shellCd restores lightning; own-property difficulty resolution; reviewer approved.
Task 2: complete (task-2-review.md spec+quality approved, focused VM checks passed).
Task 3: complete (task-3-review.md spec+quality approved, actual World constraint VM checks passed).
Task 4 root: integrated four difficulty scene, 900sec final, chest menus, HUD, grimorio, controls, boss scaling, API migration/difficulty score/ranking. Backend19 tests passed; controls8 browser checks passed. Full browser expansion and account flow testing in progress.
Task 4: complete pending whole-branch review. Backend19 passed; accountbrowser7 passed; controls8 passed; expansion8 passed with900.05s simulation/peak240/noJSerrors. Final touch/screenshot polish rerun in progress. No parked/deferred findings.
Whole-branch review found 3Important/2Minor: touchsecondpointer, reachablechest, eventsbypassreservation, tinycapordinary, Endlabeldepth. Dispatching single finalfixwave; all five accepted.
Ruling: custom capacity1 cannot host2simultaneousminis; preserve livingmini and retry pendingone rather than silently destroyit; defaults240 mustspawnontime withreserves. Cost: administrativecustomextreme can defersecondmini.
